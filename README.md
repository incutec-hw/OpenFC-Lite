Intentionally omitted to keep it small and cheap: barometer, integrated ELRS receiver, onboard WS2812B LEDs (LED-strip pad only), onboard SPI blackbox flash (microSD instead).

## Status

Rev 1 boards have been received and brought up. The custom Betaflight target builds and flashes; USB enumeration, IMU, SD card blackbox, and the switchable 10V VTX rail are confirmed working on bench. Bring-up of motors, external RX, and the analog OSD chain is in progress. See the [Rev 2 Change List](#rev-2-change-list) for hardware fixes scheduled for the next revision.

## IMU

The IMU footprint is LGA-14 (2.5×3 mm), routed with pins 2/3 → GND and pins 10/11 → NC, so it accepts **both TDK (ICM-426xx/456xx) and ST (LSM6D*) families**. Choosing the IMU is a part-population decision, not a layout change.

- **Rev 1** populates **LSM6DSV16XTR** for development only.
- **The Rev 2 IMU is not yet decided** — to be selected after more bench and flight testing.
- Note: TDK parts use a CLKIN line to eliminate sample-timing jitter; ST parts have no CLKIN/SYNC. This couples to the SPI-bus cleanup in the change list below.

## Firmware

A custom Betaflight target (`OPENFC_LITE_MINI_RP2350B`, `MANUFACTURER_ID = OPFC`, `FC_TARGET_MCU = RP2350B`) defines:

- Motor map matching the Rev 1 silkscreen (M1..M4 = GPIO31..GPIO28)
- `USE_SDCARD_SPI` on SPI1 for blackbox
- `USE_PINIO` on GPIO11 for the switchable 10V VTX rail
- FB_OSD framework wired but disabled by default (enable once the analog OSD chain is verified on hardware — note the RP2350B FB_OSD driver is still an open upstream PR stack)

Build (requires a Betaflight checkout with `pico-sdk` and the BF-pinned ARM toolchain):

```sh
make picotool_install
make arm_sdk_install
make CONFIG=OPENFC_LITE_MINI_RP2350B
```

Output is a `.uf2` in `obj/`. Hold BOOTSEL, plug in USB, and drag the UF2 onto the `RP2350` mass-storage drive that mounts.

## PIO Allocation

The RP2350B has 3 PIO blocks × 4 state machines (12 total):

| Block | Function |
|---|---|
| PIO0 | DShot motor output (4 SMs, one per motor) |
| PIO1 | Software UART (PIO UART0 + PIO UART1 — TX and RX programs) |
| PIO2 | LED strip + analog OSD pixel timing |

Legend: 🔧 field swap (value/part only) · 🔌 wiring / topology change · 🔍 decision / investigation · ✅ resolved / done on Rev 2 schematic

### Power
- ✅ **HW-5 — U3/U4 bucks**: LMR51420 (2A) → **LMR51430YFDDCR** (3A, C5219261) — fitted, same SOT-23-6. *Clean the `TI ` prefix out of the MPN field so LCSC/MPN exact-match works for BOM/assembly.*
- ✅ **HW-2 — R30** (10V FB, R29=100k top): 6.8k → **6.49k** (E96, what was in stock). Vout = 0.6·(1 + 100/6.49) = **9.85V** (~1.5% low — fine).
- ✅ **HW-1 — C28** (10V buck output cap): **kept 22µF 16V X5R 0603** (decided against 25V). Voltage margin OK (10V on 16V); DC-bias derates effective C to ~7–11µF, which with the 4.7µH inductor raises 10V ripple but is acceptable for a **digital** VTX rail.
- ✅ **HW-3 — L2/L3 inductors**: **both rails = 4.7µH (XRTC303020D4R7MBCA)** (decided against 10µH on L2). 10V ripple ≈1.17A p-p at 6S; peak well under the 3A part. *Verify the inductor Isat ≥ ~4A.*
- ✅ **HW-8 — U6 gyro LDO**: **kept NCV8187AMT180TAG** (300 mA) for its PSRR — electrically ample (gyro analog is single-digit mA). ⚠️ BF §3.1.2 lists ≥500 mA; confirm whether that's hard-gated at submission. Low stock → consign if needed.

### MCU / USB (per Raspberry Pi RP2350 datasheet)
- ✅ **R12/R13/R14**: **no change** — keep all at 30Ω. USB FS is impedance-tolerant (30 vs 27Ω inaudible to enumeration); R14 (VREG_AVDD RC filter) 30 vs 33Ω is negligible. Single resistor value = better DFM.
- 🔍 **D1 — USB ESD (USBLC6-2P6)**: removed on current schematic. ⚠️ **Recommend restoring.** USB is the most-handled / most-exposed interface; the RP2354B PHY isn't rated for system-level (IEC 61000-4-2 8kV) ESD, and the part is tiny/cheap/low-C. The "inconsistency" argument favors adding TVS to the *other* exposed I/O, not stripping USB. **Pending final call.**

### LEDs
- ✅ All indicator LEDs **0201 → 0402** (0201 too fragile — broke during nut install).
- ✅ **HW-4 — D2** (LED0 status, GPIO12): green → **blue** (XL-1005UBC, C22355736). BF §3.1.4.6.
- ✅ **LED series resistors recalculated for ~1mA** (greens = XL-1005UGC, C965793). Vf@1mA estimated: blue ≈2.75V, green ≈2.6V.

  | LED | Color | Source | Old R | **New R (E24)** | I |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | D2 (LED0) | Blue | GPIO12 (~3.3V) | 30R | **510Ω** | ~1.0mA |
  | D7 | Green | +3.3V | 30R | **680Ω** | ~1.0mA |
  | D5 | Green | +5V (5V_BUCK) | 200R | **2.4kΩ** | ~1.0mA |
  | D4 | Green | +10V | 470R | **7.5kΩ** | ~1.0mA |

  D2/D7 sit on 3.3V with low headroom → current is Vf-sensitive; if dim, D2→430Ω, D7→560Ω. Optional: D2→330Ω (~2mA) for daylight pre-arm visibility.

### Signals / connectivity (wiring — manual)
- 🔌 **SPI0 cleanup**: group **GYRO_CS** into the SPI bus (with SCK/MOSI/MISO); drop the IMU **CLKIN/SYNC** net (GPIO15) — ST gyros have no SYNC. Same regroup for **FLASH_CS** (SD). ⚠️ If a TDK IMU is chosen, CLKIN is useful — couple to the IMU decision.
- ✅ **SBUS inverter removed** (GPIO9). Confirmed safe: BF PICO inverts at the RP2350 pad IO-mux (`gpio_set_inover/outover(GPIO_OVERRIDE_INVERT)`), auto-set for SBUS, works on native + PIO UARTs. The SBUS line wires straight to a UART/PIO-UART **RX** GPIO; firmware inverts.
- 🔌 **HW-6 — ESC connector P1**: mirror reversed pinout **+ add telemetry pin** (BF 8-pin: Current = pin 3, Telem = pin 4). **Safety-critical** — current pinout shorts VBAT to a GPIO on a standard BF harness.
- 🔌 **HW-7** — Add **battery reverse-polarity protection** (PMOS RPP).
- ✅ **HW-11 — Beeper**: done — **N-MOS low-side switch** (Q2 DMN1150UFB-7B, R20 1k gate, R23 100k pulldown, BEEPER = GPIO7). Better than the NPN spec. *Verify: (1) flyback diode is across the buzzer (cathode → +supply, anode → drain), not just the FET body diode; (2) DMN1150UFB-7B is logic-level (turns on hard at 3.3V).*
- 🔌 **SD card**: wire compatible with both SPI and SDIO; use SPI for now (see SDIO decision below).

### Analog OSD (BOM + front-end)

Context: OSD is non-functional on Rev 1. In pass-through (OSD_EN held low) the monitor switches to AV (it *sees* a feed) but shows snow — so sync reaches the monitor but is too marginal to lock. Wiring/pinouts of all OSD ICs were verified correct against datasheets; this is a component-suitability + front-end problem, not a connectivity bug. Leading cause: the DC-coupled gain-×2 buffer parks the sync tip on the 0 V rail. Confirm on the bench (tap U19 IN+ → monitor; scope U19 OUT) before committing the front-end change.

- 🔧 **HW-12 — U19 op-amp**: TLV9061IDPWR (C2057878, 10 MHz / 6.5 V/µs, X2SON-5) → **COS8051SOT (C7463385)** — 175 MHz / 150 V/µs RRIO video amp (AD8051-class), 2.5–5.5 V, SOT-23-5, ~$0.24, ~11.5k stock. TLV9061 is under-spec for composite video (≈5 MHz closed-loop at gain 2; chroma needs ≈28 V/µs vs 6.5). ⚠️ New footprint — verify pinout from datasheet (expected AD8051-standard: OUT-1 / V−-2 / +IN-3 / −IN-4 / V+-5; differs from the X2SON TLV9061). Fast part → keep decoupling tight to pin 5, feedback (R47) short, retain R48 series isolation.
- 🔌 **HW-13 — OSD output front-end** *(leading fix for the snow; bench-confirm first)*: the buffer is DC-coupled with no sync clamp, so on single supply the sync tip sits against the 0 V rail where the output is weakest → ill-defined sync → no lock. Add **AC-coupling + DC-restore (sync clamp)** to bias the sync tip ~0.3–0.5 V above ground before the gain stage, and **power U19 from +5 V** for headroom. A dedicated SD-video driver (THS7314-class, integrated DC-restore + 6 dB + 75 Ω drive) is the cleaner alternative if board space allows.
- 🔧 **HW-14 — U20 comparator (sync sep)**: TLV3201AIDBVR (C105188, SOT-23-5, 4.6 mm²) → **TLV7031DPWR (C2876045)** — push-pull, RRI, **X2SON-5 (0.8×0.8, ~0.64 mm² → ~75% smaller)**, 7 mV hysteresis (vs 1.2 mV; better noise immunity). 3 µs prop delay is **symmetric** (tPHL=tPLH, datasheet §5.8) → preserves HSYNC/VSYNC pulse-width discrimination, adds only a constant ~22 px horizontal offset → **retune PIO `hshiftA/B/C`** (drop ~225 clocks). Residual risk = delay asymmetry over temp/process vs the ±1.1 µs PIO HSYNC window → bench-verify field lock. Conservative fallback: **TLV3201AIDCKR (SC70-5, pin-identical drop-in, 40 ns)** if the X2SON regresses sync.
- 🔌 **HW-15 — OSD_EN select pull-down**: add a weak pull-down on U18 pin 6 (S / OSD_EN). Datasheet: the select must not float; this also defaults the switch to pass-through (transparent) before firmware drives the GPIO.
- ✅ **U18 SN74LVC1G3157DTBR (C2673087)** and **D9 SDM02U30LP3-7B** — verified correct, **no change**.
- ✅ **OSD GPIO mapping** — resolved in the BF target: OSD_W/EN/SYNC are on **GPIO4/5/6 (PA4/5/6)**, not GPIO33/34/35 (those pads are unconnected); beeper is **GPIO7**. Config corrected.

### Decisions / investigations
- 🔍 **IMU** — undecided for Rev 2; see [IMU](#imu).
- ✅ **U5 power MUX** — **TPS2116DRLR** confirmed (auto-select USB/BATT).
- ✅ **SDIO on Pico** — **stay on SPI.** Betaflight PICO supports SD blackbox over **SPI only** (PR #14567); no SDIO under `src/platform/PICO/`, no open PR. SDIO would give ~10× throughput (~25 MB/s vs ~2 MB/s — needed for 4kHz+ full-field logging) but requires a 4-bit HW bus *and* firmware that doesn't exist. SPI1 microSD is correct.
- ✅ **CRIT-2 — motor order**: keep reversed silk (eases routing); **resolve in the BF target's DShot motor resource order** so M1–M4 map to the pads. Documented in the target.
- 🔍 **CRIT-3 — FB_OSD upstream**: the RP2350B analog-OSD driver PR stack (#14882) is still open; no flyable upstream binary yet. Track before tape-out.
- ✅ **SWD connector** — **not adding.** RP2354B flashes over USB (UF2/BOOTSEL); SWD is only for live debug. Optional test pads cost nothing but no connector needed.
